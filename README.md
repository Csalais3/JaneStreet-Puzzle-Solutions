## May 2025: Number Cross 5 (Difficulty level: TBD)

## April 2025: Sum One Somewhere (Difficulty Level: Medium)
This month's puzzle took basic concepts of probability theory and and calculus to locate a tangible searchable range, we can use to approximate the probability to 10 decimal places. Overall, it was an interesting problem, that took a good amount of thought to solve.
